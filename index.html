        <h2>My History</h2>
            <p>My name is Juan and I have a beautiful family.  When I was younger I worked in a chocolate factory and was involved in a horrible
                smelting accident that left me with an unquenchable desire for chocolate.  Now I stalk the streets at night, fighting crime with my
                faithful cainine companion, Hershey.  In my spare time I make chocolate Mexican food, Chocolate Chinese food and of course
                everyone's favorite, chocolate Italian food.  </p>
